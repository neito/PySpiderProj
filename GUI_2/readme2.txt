currently, these functions just make a basic box. I am adding functionality to 
the search button as I commit this, but I wanted to get what I have to you guys
in case you have been waiting for this class. I will hopefully be able to add
the version with the working buttons in an hour or two.

When adding names to the labels for the text boxes, make sure every name is the
same length, padding short ones with spaces if you have to. Also, add the things
you want in the order in which you need them.

back to work...
